# unity-cardboard-test

Toy Unity 5.x project for testing Cardboard SDK. It consists of a simple scene where the viewer alternatively moves forward and backwards while two planes are rendered in front of him / her.

## Building the proyect

1. Prepare your Unity install for building for Android.
2. Clone this repo. We will be referring to the local directory as *LOCAL_DIR*.
3. Open the Unity project at *LOCAL_DIR*/UnityCardboardProject.
4. Inside Unity, open the scene in Assets/Scenes/SampleScene.unity
5. At this point you can preview the scene on the Unity editor itself or build the project for your Android. In the preview you can look around by holding the left alt button pressed and moving the mouse.
6. Enjoy!
